            WWTA began in the spring of 2010 as a pilot program at Jonas Clarke
            Middle School (JCMS) in Lexington, MA, with partner teacher Michelle
            Bartley. Pat Udomprasert and 3 Ambassadors worked with Ms. Bartley
            and her 80 sixth-grade students. The students used WWT to research
            astronomy topics of their choice, and they used it to create their
            own presentations to share what they learned with their classmates.
          </p>
          <p class="they-also-used">
            They also used WWT to visualize the cause of the Moon's phases.

            In 2011, we expanded the program to include the entire sixth grade
            at JCMS, including teachers Rick Rogers and Jim Werner. We also
            worked with 100 sixth-grade students at Prospect Hill Academy in
            Somerville, MA.

            In 2012, with funding from NSF Cyberlearning (IIS-1254535), we
            developed and tested the moon phases lab and expanded the program to
            Diamond Middle School in Lexington and continued work with JCMS.
